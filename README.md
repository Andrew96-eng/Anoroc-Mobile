# Anoroc

## Project Overview
Considering the recent Global Emergency, it has been more apparent than ever before that the ability to track and trace a contingent is of the utmost importance. Cotangent tracking allows users to avoid potential infections and for authorities to be able to flatten the infection rate curve by the use of restrictions or medical services at the hot spots of the tracing.
The application will allow the tracking of multiple contingents that are deemed as pandemics by the World Health Organisation, that are currently affecting the country that the user is in. Often this will only be one contingent at a time; however, the system will have the capability to track multiple.

The application proposed is a tool that tracks the user’s location data on a mobile app, that is sent to the server and stored in a manner that both protects the user’s identity and location, as well as provides a way to generate spatial data that can be analyzed and displayed in the manner of a heat map on the user’s mobile device or the web app. User’s should be able to view and download their location data as well as sensitive data they have opted into entering.

The application will allow the user to log in or register using either an Anoroc account or by the use of their social media accounts (Google, Facebook). Once logged in, the user will be shown their profile page which holds notifications, their recent transits (entered by the user or automatically tracked), and their friends and family.
From the user’s profile page, they can tap on any of the views on that page to enlarge them and receive more information and functionality.

The user can also choose to run the purge procedure, after several confirms the system will delete all data associated with the user and the location data associated with visits to hot spots. The user will become anonymous. All location data that involves a route taken or any other location data that could be used to trace or identify an individual will be permanently deleted.

The Notification view will show the user the notifications that they have received and allow the user to act based on the kind of notification. The user can opt-in or out of receiving notifications from their friend’s movements. The notification types are as follows:
 * Severe: You or a friend have come into contact with an infected individual.
 * Warn: You or a friend have visited a hot spot area.
 * Info: Notify the user about current developments of the contingent in their area.
 * Message: The user has received a message from their friend.
 
The Recent Transits page will show the user’s last 5 movements in a map view and will be able to show the user if or where their path took them through hot spots.
The Friends view will allow the user to view all their friends, send their friends a message, add new friends, and delete friends. The Friends page will also allow the user to send an update to the system of the worst-case outcome of that friend. The system will then notify that friend and if no action is taken on that notification after a set amount of time the system will run the purge procedure.

The Map view will allow the user to scroll around the country and see the hot spots that are generated onto the map in real-time as the user scrolls over that area. The user can also register an itinerary on this page which will show the user their route and the hot spots that they will pass through so that the user can determine the risk. The user can select which contingent from a shortlist that they want to view the data for.

The Medical view will allow the user to enter their current condition and select the contingent that they have, the medication they are receiving as well as their feedback and that medication that they are receiving.
